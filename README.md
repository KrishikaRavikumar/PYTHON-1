The import numpy as np statement in Python is essential for leveraging the capabilities of the NumPy library, a fundamental tool for numerical computing and data analysis. By importing NumPy with the alias np, developers streamline code readability and access to NumPy's extensive functionality. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to manipulate these arrays efficiently.

The load_and_preprocess_image function exemplifies this integration, utilizing both NumPy and Keras, a high-level deep learning API. This function is designed to load an image from a specified file path, resize it as per specified dimensions (target_size), convert it into a NumPy array, and normalize its pixel values to facilitate machine learning model input. NumPy's np.expand_dims is employed to add a batch dimension to the image array, aligning it with the input expectations of Keras models. This preprocessing step, which divides pixel values by 255.0, ensures that the image data is scaled to a range suitable for neural network operations, enhancing model training and inference accuracy. Overall, the combination of NumPy and Keras enables efficient handling and processing of image data, supporting various deep learning applications seamlessly within Python environments.
